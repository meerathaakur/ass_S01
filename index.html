        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

        <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as <b>Fe</b> for iron. <b>H</b> for hydrogen, and <b>O</b> for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <dfn>chemical equations</dfn>. Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn>:</p>

        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> => 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i> to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>.</p>

        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>

        <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>

        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>

        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
